#Openfda Shiny apps

##Overview

This repository contains the source code for several R Shiny apps that use the openfda API ( see https://open.fda.gov/ ) .  The goal of these apps is to show how to demonstrate some of the ways the openfda data can be used.

## Note
These apps make use of the rOpenHealth openfda R package ( https://github.com/rOpenHealth/openfda ).  Because this package has not been added to CRAN, you will need to install the devtools package in order to use it.
